      <h1><b>Report: Web Development Project</b></h1><br><br><br>
      <h2><b>Hubert Simon Bom</b></h2><br>

      <p>
        <b>Introduction:</b><br>
        This website is a newspaper about football, it gives the recent updates on the scores of matches and transfer rumors. I made sure that the structure of the website is always connected to the navigation menu. The navigation menu has 3
        categories the home page, the matches page, and the news page. The home page gives a basic summary of the whole website, while the matches and news pages are more organized with their specific content. The news articles are individual pages.
        All these pages are linked to the navigation bar, so you will always be able to return to the home page. The 3 main structure of the website is the header, middle and footer section. The header and footer section is pretty much the same for
        all pages, but the middle section is different each time. I also made sketches for the wireframe and the web structure, I place these sketches in the appendices section.<br><br>

        <b>Inspiration:</b><br>
        I was inspired by multiple websites. My main inspiration was voetbalprimeur.nl website but I was also inspired by ajax.nl and voetbalniews.be, I was able to design my wireframes from those sites.<br><br>

        <b>Accessiblity:</b><br>
        The 3 accessible features I added are font zoom, keyboard navigation, and color contrast. Each of these features makes the website more accessible for people with visual impairments or physical disabilities. For the color contrast accessible I used the axe devToll from google chrome, which help me identify the text that had problems with contrast in the testing phase. Then I used a contrast checker from the webaim website to find a proper contrast color and then replaced it in my CSS. For the navigation, I added the tabindex 0 into my first div, so if the user presses the tab key it will directly tab the 1ste link on the website. As for the text size I used javascript and added the zoom letters at the bottom of the pages.<br><br>

        <b>Usability:</b><br>
        I improved the usability of the website by making sure that the home page gave you access to almost all the links and info on the website. It gives a summary of all the info you can find on the website, this helps you save time. The
        navigation bar makes the site more usable by always being present on each page. So you would be able to go back to the 3 category pages easily. I also tested multiple times links of the website to make sure that there are no dead
        links.<br><br>

        <b>Learning:</b><br>
        I used a lot of bootstrap for my website and I learned a lot about how to use it to design my website. I used the bootstrap website to find information and examples, by doing this I got a better understanding of how to implement bootstrap for my project. I also learned how to implement javascript into my website from the Coursera videos. I also learned how to implement different fonts from the google fonts site, this enabled me to use more unique fonts for my website and be more creative.<br><br>

        <b>Evaluation I:</b><br>
        I think the implementation of bootstrap to my website was successful. It allowed me to code the front end of the website more easily and faster while still being user-friendly and beautiful. Especially for the size of the grids, I think using bootstrap makes the size of the grids way more accurate than calculating it yourself.<br><br>

        <b>Evaluation II:</b><br>
        I think the implementation of my javascript functionality to the website might need improvement. This was the most difficult part for me of this project. This is also the first time I implemented this on my website so it was all new to me. But I do know the more I practice, the better I will be able to use it later. This was the same for me when it came to HTML and CSS usage, the more I practice the better I got at using it. So for next time I just need to keep practicing using javascript and I will be able to make a better website while implementing javascript.<br><br>
