        <p>PUBLISHED: 11:01 GMT, 22 January 2022 <br>
          By OLIVER HOLT
          <hr>
          <!-- Main Text Article -->
          A sense of liberation spread around Goodison Park before kick-off. It did not last for long. <br><br>

          If there was lingering relief that the club had been rid of the rule of Rafa Benitez, it was soon replaced by the tyranny of fear. <br><br>

          Everton's defeat to Aston Villa left them perched precariously above the drop zone. To adapt the rallying cry of their new caretaker manager, Duncan Ferguson, if they did not already know they were in a relegation fight, they do
          now.<br><br>

          Agent Rafa may be gone but another of Liverpool's favourite sons came back to haunt them instead. <br><br>

          If Everton are a club in freefall, Steven Gerrard is already making his mark on Villa and driving them upwards. The scoreline was close but Villa were the better side by a distance. <br><br>

          It was apt that the game's most creative player, Emiliano Buendia, should have scored the only goal.<br><br>

          So Everton lie only five points above the bottom three and still have to visit the teams who occupied the relegation places on Saturday afternoon, Watford, Newcastle and Burnley. <br><br>

          The club is riven by dissent and division, too. After the final whistle, a few hundred fans stayed behind in the Gwladys Street End, holding banners and chanting 'Sack the Board' over and over again.<br><br>

          There was not much to cheer them here. Ferguson had won more friends by leaving some money behind the bar of the Winslow Hotel on Goodison Road to buy a drink for any Everton fan who visited before the game but free drinks only get you so
          far. <br><br>

          Everton had plenty of fight but very little guile. Their barrage of long balls were comfortably repelled by the Villa defence.<br><br>

          They may have to face an FA inquiry, too. After Buendia's goal at the end of the first half, missiles were thrown from the Gwladys Street as the Villa players celebrated. Two Villa players fell to the floor. <br><br>

          The habit of hurling objects from the stands is becoming a serious problem for the English game. It is time that harsh punishments were visited on fans and clubs where it persists before a player is seriously hurt.
